BaoGe(Neal) loves curry rice, but not mixed curry rice (ga_li_ban_fan).
So he wants to make curry.

Below is a list of the ingredients he needs:

- rice
- meat
- spice

***Then he will go to the kitchen to make a lovely curry rice #not mixed curry rice#***

here are some hints:

0. Git is your good friend

1. The rice may fall on the ground. There might be a way to find it.

2. Rice is edible only if it is unshelled. The shell is of a medium size. 

3. A bowl of rice = (2^12+0.1) grains of rice.

5. Rice'c content needs to be copied to the origin file.

6. A kind of 20-inch snake is called Python, which is delicious.

7. snake usage : 

./snake human play
./snake snake_hacker #ai play
./snake snake hacker -n #ai play without game windows(for workstation)


8. ./knife --help might help you

9. a good curry requires
-curry_leaf
-turmeric
-onion
-coriander seeds

but they might be dirty since there are too many numeric characters and underscore charcters in them.

10. a good curry required baked spices

-curry leaf, baked once
-curry leaf and turmeric, baked together once
-curry leaf, turmeric and onion, baked together once
-curry leaf, turmeric, onion, coriander_seed, baked together once

11. bake usage

./bake <file1> <file2> ....


12. A powerful mom can make many dishes, except BeautifulSoup

13. Good Luck and Stay Cool, but not a cool dish with unexpected actions which would require you to re-download the whole file

14. no 4. because GuÄ«do Misuta in JOJO5 hate 4
